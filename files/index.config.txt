 * This value must start with 'site-', i.e. 'site-domain' or 'site-something'. This is to
 * ensure that ProcessWire's htaccess file can recognize and protect files in that directory.
 *
 * Note that if your site may be accessed at either domain.com OR www.domain.com, then you'll
 * want to include entries for both, pointing to the same /site-domain/ directory. 
 * 
 * Each /site/ dir has it's own /site/config.php file that should be pointing to a separate
 * database. You shouldn't have two different /site/ dirs sharing the same database.
